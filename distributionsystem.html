Distributed Databases
n	Homogeneous distributed databases
l	Same software/schema on all sites, data may be partitioned among sites
l	Goal: provide a view of a single database, hiding details of distribution
n	Heterogeneous distributed databases
l	Different software/schema on different sites
l	Goal: integrate existing databases to provide useful functionality
n	Differentiate between local and global transactions
l	A local transaction accesses data in the single site at which the transaction was initiated.
l	A global transaction either accesses data in a site different from the one at which the transaction was initiated or accesses data in several different sites.
Implementation Issues for Distributed Databases
n	a Atomicity needed even for transactions that update data at multiple sites
n	The two-phase commit protocol (2PC) is used to ensure atomicity
l	Basic idea:  each site executes transaction until just before commit, and the leaves final decision to a coordinator
l	Each site must follow decision of coordinator, even if there is a failure while waiting for coordinators decision
n	2PC is not always appropriate:  other transaction models based on persistent messaging, and workflows, are also used 
n	Distributed concurrency control (and deadlock detection) required
n	Data items may be replicated to improve datavailability
