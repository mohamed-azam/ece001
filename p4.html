Application Architecture Evolution
Three distinct era’s of application architecture
	
	Centralized Systems
Run on a single computer system and do not interact with other computer systems.
General-purpose computer system: one to a few CPUs and a number of device controllers that are connected through a common bus that provides access to shared memory.
Single-user system (e.g., personal computer or workstation): desk-top unit, single user, usually has only one CPU  and one or two hard disks; the OS may support only one user.
Multi-user system: more disks, more memory, multiple CPUs, and a multi-user OS. Serve a large number of users who are connected to the system vie terminals. Often called server systems.

<p>Web Interface
Web browsers have become the de-facto standard user interface to databases
Enable large numbers of users to access databases from anywhere
Avoid the need for downloading/installing specialized code, while providing a good graphical user interface
Javascript, Flash and other scripting languages run in browser, but are downloaded transparently
Examples: banks, airline and rental car reservations, university course registration and grading, as soon.
The World Wide Web
The Web is a distributed information system based on hypertext.
Most Web documents are hypertext documents formatted via the HyperText Markup Language (HTML)
HTML documents contain
text along with font specifications, and other formatting instructions
hypertext links to other documents, which can be associated with regions of the text.
forms, enabling users to enter data which can then be sent back to the Web server
Uniform Resources Locators
In the Web, functionality of pointers is provided by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs).
URL example:            http://www.acm.org/sigmod 
The first part indicates how the document is to be accessed
“http” indicates that the document is to be accessed using the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol.
The second part gives the unique name of a machine on the Internet.
The rest of the URL identifies the document within the machine.
The local identification can be:
The path name of a file on the machine, or
An identifier (path name) of a program, plus arguments to be passed to the program
