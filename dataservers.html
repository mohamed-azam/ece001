<h4> Server process Structure: </h4>
 Data Servers
n	Used in high-speed LANs, in cases where
l	The clients are comparable in processing power to the server
l	The tasks to be executed are compute intensive.
n	Data are shipped to clients where processing is performed, and then shipped results back to the server.
n	This architecture requires full back-end functionality at the clients.
n	Used in many object-oriented database systems 
n	Issues:
l	Page-Shipping versus Item-Shipping
l	Locking
l	Data Caching
l	Lock Caching
n	Page-shipping versus item-shipping
l	Smaller unit of shipping  more messages
l	Worth prefetching related items along with requested item
l	Page shipping can be thought of as a form of prefetching
n	Locking
l	Overhead of requesting and getting locks from server is high due to message delays
l	Can grant locks on requested and prefetched items; with page shipping, transaction is granted lock on whole page.
l	Locks on a prefetched item can be P{called back} by the server, and returned by client transaction if the prefetched item has not been used.  
l	Locks on the page can be deescalated to locks on items in the page when there are lock conflicts. Locks on unused items can then be returned to server.
