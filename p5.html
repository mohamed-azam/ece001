<p>Distributed Systems
Data spread over multiple machines (also referred to as sites or nodes).
Network interconnects the machines
Data shared by users on multiple machines
Distributed Databases
Homogeneous distributed databases
Same software/schema on all sites, data may be partitioned among sites
Goal: provide a view of a single database, hiding details of distribution
Heterogeneous distributed databases
Different software/schema on different sites
Goal: integrate existing databases to provide useful functionality
Differentiate between local and global transactions
A local transaction accesses data in the single site at which the transaction was initiated.
A global transaction either accesses data in a site different from the one at which the transaction was initiated or accesses data in several different sites.
Implementation Issues for Distributed Databases
a Atomicity needed even for transactions that update data at multiple sites
The two-phase commit protocol (2PC) is used to ensure atomicity
Basic idea:  each site executes transaction until just before commit, and the leaves final decision to a coordinator
Each site must follow decision of coordinator, even if there is a failure while waiting for coordinators decision
2PC is not always appropriate:  other transaction models based on persistent messaging, and workflows, are also used 
Distributed concurrency control (and deadlock detection) required
Data items may be replicated to improve datavailability
